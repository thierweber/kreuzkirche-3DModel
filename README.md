# Welcome to the ETH Zurich Geomatics Master Project: <br> "3D Model of a cultural heritage building" <br>
This repository contains methods and results of a ETH Zurich Geomatics MSc project developed by Thierry Weber. The project had three main goals: Creating a **digital twin** of a cultural heritage building in Switzerland, including the 3D model in a **VR-Experience** and **assessing the accuracy** of the obtained 3D model. 

## The Model:
The following renderings show the highest quality Mesh of Kreuzkirche created in this project. </br>

## Point Cloud Accuracy Assessment 
The following figures show the cloud-to-cloud distance between the point cloud obtained using data and the one obtained only from drone photogrammetry. The differences are in meters. 
As expected, the areas with high discrepancies are the once with data gabs from the drone data. The back facade (alot of red in the plot) was close to high trees, which prevented 
detailed drone images of the facade.
